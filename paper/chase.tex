\section{The Chase}

	The \emph{chase} is a function that, when given a gemoetric theory, will
	generate a set of jointly minimal models for that theory. More
	specifically, if $U$ is the set of all models obtained from an execution of
	the chase over a geometric theory $T$, for any model $\mathbb{M}$ such that
	$\mathbb{M} \models T$, there is a homomorphism from some $u \in U$ to
	$\mathbb{M}$.

	There are three types of runs of the chase:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item a non-empty result in finite time
	\item an empty result in finite time
	\item an infinite run, with possible return dependent on implementation
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Algorithm}

	Recall that geometric formul{\ae} are of the form
	\[\bigwedge A \to \bigvee \bigwedge \exists \vec{x} A\]
	where $A$ is an atomic formula and all sets can be zero-length.
