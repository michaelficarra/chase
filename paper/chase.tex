\section{The Chase}

	The \emph{chase} is a function that, when given a gemoetric theory, will
	generate all minimal models for that theory.

	There are three types of runs of the chase:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item a non-empty result in finite time
	\item an empty result in finite time
	\item an infinite run, with possible return dependent on implementation
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Algorithm}

	Recall that geometric formul{\ae} are of the form
	\[\bigwedge A \to \bigvee \bigwedge \exists \vec{x} A\]
	where $A$ is an atomic formula and all sets can be zero-length.

	\subsection{Applications}
