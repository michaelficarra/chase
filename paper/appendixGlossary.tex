			decryption and unpairing operations
		\item[efficient]
			a protocol is efficient if, for every sending \emph{node} $m$ and

			a \emph{homomorphism} $h : \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{B}$ is also an
			isomorphism when $h$ is 1:1 and onto and the inverse
			function $h^{-1} : \mathbb{B} \to \mathbb{A}$ is a homomorphism.
		\item[jointly minimal models]
			a set of models $\mathcal{M}$ is said to be jointly minimal
			for a set of formul{\ae} $\Sigma$ when every model $\mathbb{N}$
			such that $\mathbb{N} \models \Sigma$ has a \emph{homomorphism} from a
			model $\mathbb{M} \in \mathcal{M}$ to $\mathbb{N}$.
		\item[message]
			a \emph{term} sent or received by a \emph{node}
		\item[minimal model]
			a model for a theory $T$ with the special property that there exists
			a \emph{homomorphism} from the model to any other model that
			satisfies $T$; also called \emph{universal model}
		\item[model]
			a model $\mathbb{M}$ is a construct that consists of a set, denoted
			$|\mathbb{M}|$, called the \emph{universe} or \emph{domain} of
			$\mathbb{M}$ and a relation $R^\mathbb{M}_k \subseteq |\mathbb{M}|$
			for each pairing of a predicate $R$ and an arity $k$ in a vocabulary
			$\mathcal{V}$
		\item[nonce]
			a uniquely-originating basic term
		\item[normal]
			a protocol is \emph{normal} if, for any path through adversary
			strands, the adversary always either performs a generation followed
			by zero or more construction operations or performs zero or more
			deconstruction operations followed by zero or more construction
			operations
		\item[origination]
			a \emph{term} $t$ originates on a \emph{node} $n$ of a
			\emph{strand} $s$ if $n$ is a sending node, $t$ is an
			\emph{ingredient} of the \emph{message} of $n$, and $t$ is not an
			ingredient of any previous node on $s$
		\item[positive-existential form]

			relation symbol $R$ and tuple $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n \rangle$
			where $a \subseteq |\mathbb{A}|$, $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n  \rangle
			\in R^\mathbb{A}$ if and only if $\langle h(a_0) , \ldots , h(a_n)
