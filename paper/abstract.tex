This paper describes a method, referred to as the chase, for generating jointly
minimal models for a geometric theory. A minimal model for a theory is a model
for which there exists a homomorphism to any other model that can satisfy the
theory. These models are useful in solutions to problems in many practical
applications, including but not limited to firewall configuration examination,
protocol analysis, and access control evaluation. Also described is a Haskell
implementation of the chase and its development process and design decisions.
