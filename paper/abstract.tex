This paper describes an algorithm, referred to as The Chase, that generates
models for a geometric theory. A universal model for a theory is a model for
which there exists a homomorphism to any model that can satisfy the theory. A
set of jointly minimal models is a set of models for which there exists a
homomorphism from one or more models in the set to any other model that can
satisfy the theory. Such sets are useful in solutions to problems in many
practical applications, including but not limited to firewall configuration
examination, protocol analysis, and access control evaluation. A Haskell
implementation of the chase and its development process and design decisions
are documented. The chase implementation is then used to generate sets of
jointly universal models for a theory that represent a cryptographic protocol.
