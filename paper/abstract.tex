This paper describes an algorithm, referred to as the chase, that generates
jointly universal models for a geometric theory. A universal model for a theory is
a model for which there exists a homomorphism to any other model that can
satisfy the theory. These models are useful in solutions to problems in many
practical applications, including but not limited to firewall configuration
examination, protocol analysis, and access control evaluation. A Haskell
implementation of the chase and its development process and design decisions
are documented. The chase implementation is then used to generate universal
models for a theory that represents a crptographic protocol. The results will
be discussed and analysed.
