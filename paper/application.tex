\section{An Extended Application: \\ Cryptographic Protocol Analysis}

	The chase can be used for protocol analysis. A technique for the analysis
	of protocols has been defined wherein the essentially different runs of a
	protocol need to be known. These essentially different protocol runs are
	analagous to minimal models.  When a protocol is described using
	first-order logic, the chase can find such minimal models.

	The protocol can then be analysed for any properties such as the existence
	of security violations or other unexpected behaviour.
