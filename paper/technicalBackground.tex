\section{Technical Background}

	\subsection{Definitions}

	In this paper, logic symbols and other possibly ambiguous or uncommon
	notation will be used extensively, and thusly must be clearly defined.

		\subsubsection{Models}

		A \emph{model} $\mathbb{M}$ is a construct that consists of:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item a set, referenced as $|\mathbb{M}|$, called the \emph{universe} or \emph{domain} of $\mathbb{M}$
		\item a set of pairings of a \emph{predicate} and a non-negative integral arity
		\item for each predicate $R$ with arity $k$, a relation $R^\mathbb{M}_k \subseteq |\mathbb{M}|$
		\end{itemize}
		It is important to distinguish the predicate, which is just a symbol,
		from the relation that it refers to when paired with its arity. The
		relation itself is a set of tuples of elements from the universe.

		\subsubsection{First-order Logic}

		\emph{First-order logic}, also called \emph{predicate logic}, is a
		formula logic system that is an extension of propositional logic. For
		our purposes, this logic system will not contain any constant symbols
		or function symbols, which are commonly included in first-order and
		propositional logic.

		A first-order logic formula is defined inductively by
		\begin{itemize}
		\item if $R$ is a relation symbol of arity $k$ and each of $t_0 , \ldots , t_{k-1}$ is a variable, then $R[t_0,\ldots,t_{k-1}]$ is a formula, specifically an \emph{atomic formula}
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula then $(\neg\alpha)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formulas then $(\alpha\wedge\beta)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formulas then $(\alpha\vee\beta)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formulas then $(\alpha\to\beta)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula and $x$ is a variable then $(\forall x : \alpha)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula and $\vec{x}$ is a set of variables of size $k$ then $(\forall \vec{x} : \alpha)$ is $(\forall x_0 \ldots \forall x_{k-1} : \alpha)$
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula and $x$ is a variable then $(\exists x : \alpha)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula and $\vec{x}$ is a set of variables of size $k$ then $(\exists \vec{x} : \alpha)$ is $(\forall x_0 \ldots \forall x_{k-1} : \alpha)$
		\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection{Geometric Logic}

		\emph{Geometric logic} is first-order logic with constraints on the
		shape of the expression.  Geometric logic formulas are implicitly
		universally quantified first-order logic expressions of the form \[A_0
		\wedge \ldots \wedge A_n \to E_0 \vee \ldots \vee E_m\] where $A_0
		\ldots A_n$ are atomics, $E_0 \ldots E_m$ are first-order logic
		expressions of the form $\exists_{x_0 \ldots x_k} A_0 \wedge \ldots
		\wedge \exists_{x_0 \ldots x_p} A_y$, and $n$, $m$, $k$, $p$, and $y$
		are integers greater than or equal to $0$. A set of geometric logic
		formulas is called a \emph{geometric theory}.

	\subsection{Homomorphisms}

	A \emph{homomorphism} from $\mathbb{A}$ to $\mathbb{B}$ is a function $h:
	|\mathbb{A}|\to|\mathbb{B}|$ such that, for each relation symbol $R$ and
	tuple $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n \rangle$ where $a_k \in |\mathbb{A}|$ for
	any $k$ and $0 \le k \le n$, $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n  \rangle \in
	R^\mathbb{A}$ implies $\langle h(a_0) , \ldots , h(a_n)  \rangle \in
	R^\mathbb{B}$.

	A homomorphism $h$ is also a \emph{strong homomorphism} if, for each
	relation symbol $R$ and tuple $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n \rangle$ where
	$a_k \in |\mathbb{A}|$ for any $k$ and $0 \le k \le n$, $\langle a_0 ,
	\ldots , a_n  \rangle \in R^\mathbb{A}$ if and only if $\langle h(a_0) ,
	\ldots , h(a_n)  \rangle \in R^\mathbb{B}$.

	The notation $\mathbb{M} \preceq \mathbb{N}$ means that there exists a
	homomorphism $h : \mathbb{M} \to \mathbb{N}$. The identity function is a
	homomorphism from any model $\mathbb{M}$ to itself.  Homomorphisms are
	transitive, so $\mathbb{A} \preceq \mathbb{B} \wedge \mathbb{B} \preceq
	\mathbb{C}$ implies $\mathbb{A} \preceq \mathbb{C}$. However, $\mathbb{M}
	\preceq \mathbb{N} \wedge \mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{M}$ does not imply
	that $\mathbb{M} = \mathbb{N}$.

	An \emph{isomorphism} is a homomorphism $h : \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{B}$
	where $h$ is 1:1 and onto and the inverse function $h^{-1} : \mathbb{B} \to
	\mathbb{A}$ is a homomorphism.

		\subsubsection{Significance}

		\subsubsection{Minimal Models}

		Minimal models, also called \emph{universal} models, are models for a
		theory with the special property that there exists a homomorphism from
		the minimal model to any other model satisfied by the theory. Minimal
		models have no unnecessary entities or relations and thus display the
		least amount of constraint necessary to satisfy the theory for which
		they are minimal.

		More than one minimal model may exist for a given theory, but not every
		theory must have a minimal model. \textbf{give examples}

		\subsubsection{Relation to the Chase}

		The chase is a function that, when given a gemoetric theory, will generate all minimal models
