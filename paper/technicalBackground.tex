\section{Technical Background}

	\subsection{Models}

		A \emph{model} $\mathbb{M}$ is a construct that consists of:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item a set, referenced as $|\mathbb{M}|$, called the \emph{universe} or \emph{domain} of $\mathbb{M}$
		\item a set of pairings of a \emph{predicate} and a non-negative integral arity
		\item for each predicate $R$ with arity $k$, a relation $R^\mathbb{M}_k \subseteq |\mathbb{M}|$
		\end{itemize}
		It is important to distinguish the predicate, which is just a symbol,
		from the relation that it refers to when paired with its arity. The
		relation itself is a set of tuples of elements from the universe.

	\subsection{First-order Logic}

		\emph{First-order logic}, also called \emph{predicate logic}, is a
		formal logic system. For our purposes, this logic system will not
		contain any constant symbols or function symbols, which are commonly
		included in first-order and propositional logic. We will see that these
		can be removed without loss of expressiveness in \textbf{reference to GL section}.

		A first-order logic formula is defined inductively by
		\begin{itemize}
		\item if $R$ is a relation symbol of arity $k$ and each of $x_0 \ldots x_{k-1} \in \vec{x}$ is a variable, then $R[\vec{x}]$ is a formula, specifically an \emph{atomic formula}
		\item if $x$ and $y$ are variables, then $x = y$ is a formula
		\item $\top$ and $\bot$ are formul{\ae}
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula, then $(\neg\alpha)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formul{\ae}, then $(\alpha \wedge \beta)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formul{\ae}, then $(\alpha \vee \beta)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formul{\ae}, then $(\alpha \to \beta)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula and $x$ is a variable, then $(\forall x : \alpha)$ is a formula
		\item if $\alpha$ is a formula and $x$ is a variable, then $(\exists x : \alpha)$ is a formula
		\end{itemize}

		A shorthand notation may sometimes be used which omits either the left
		or right side of an implication and denotes ($\top \to \sigma$) and
		($\sigma \to \bot$) respectively.  If $\alpha$ is a formula and
		$\vec{x}$ is a set of variables of size $k$, then $(\forall \vec{x} :
		\alpha)$ is $(\forall x_0 \ldots \forall x_{k-1} : \alpha)$.  If
		$\alpha$ is a formula and $\vec{x}$ is a set of variables of size $k$,
		then $(\exists \vec{x} : \alpha)$ is $(\exists x_0 \ldots \exists
		x_{k-1} : \alpha)$.

	\subsection{Variable Binding}

		Given a function $free$ that returns the set of free variables in a
		formula, the set of free variables in a formula is defined inductively
		as follows
		\begin{itemize}
		\item any variable occuring in an atomic formula is a free variable
		\item the set of free variables in $\top$ and $\bot$ is $\emptyset$
		\item the set of free variables in $x = y$ is $\{x,y\}$
		\item the set of free variables in $\neg\alpha$ is $free(\alpha)$
		\item the set of free variables in $\alpha \wedge \beta$ is $free(\alpha) \cup free(\beta)$
		\item the set of free variables in $\alpha \vee   \beta$ is $free(\alpha) \cup free(\beta)$
		\item the set of free variables in $\alpha \to    \beta$ is $free(\alpha) \cup free(\beta)$
		\item the set of free variables in $\forall x : \alpha$ is $free(\alpha) - \{x\}$
		\item the set of free variables in $\exists x : \alpha$ is $free(\alpha) - \{x\}$
		\end{itemize}
		A formula $\alpha$ is a \emph{sentence} if $free(\alpha) = \emptyset$.

	\subsection{Environment}

		An \emph{environment} $\lambda$ for a model $\mathbb{M}$ is a function
		from a variable $v$ to a domain element $e$ where $e \in |\mathbb{M}|$.
		The syntax $\lambda_{[v \mapsto a]}$ denotes the environment
		$\lambda'(x)$ that returns $a$ when $x=v$ and returns $\lambda(x)$
		otherwise.

	\subsection{Satisfiability}

		A model $\mathbb{M}$ is said to satisfy a formula $\sigma$ in an
		environment $\lambda$, denoted $\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \sigma$ and
		read ``under $\lambda$, $\sigma$ is true in $\mathbb{M}$", when
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $\sigma$ is a relation symbol $R$ and $R[\lambda(a_0) , \ldots , \lambda(a_n)] \in \mathbb{M}$ where $a$ is a set of variables
		\item $\sigma$ is of the form $\neg\alpha$ and $\mathbb{M} \not\models_\lambda \alpha$
		\item $\sigma$ is of the form $\alpha\wedge\beta$ and both $\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \alpha$ and $\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \beta$
		\item $\sigma$ is of the form $\alpha\vee\beta$ and either $\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \alpha$ or $\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \beta$
		\item $\sigma$ is of the form $\alpha\to\beta$ and either $\mathbb{M} \not\models_\lambda \alpha$ or $\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \beta$
		\item $\sigma$ is of the form $\forall x : \alpha$  and for every $x' \in |\mathbb{M}|$, $\mathbb{M} \models_{\lambda[x \mapsto x']} \alpha$
		\item $\sigma$ is of the form $\exists x : \alpha$  and for at least one $x' \in |\mathbb{M}|$, $\mathbb{M} \models_{\lambda[x \mapsto x']} \alpha$
		\end{itemize}
		The notation $\mathbb{M} \models \sigma$ (no environment specification)
		means that, under any environment $l$, $\mathbb{M} \models_l \sigma$.

		A model $\mathbb{M}$ satisfies a set of formul{\ae} $\Sigma$ for an
		environment $\lambda$ if for every $\sigma$ such that $\sigma \in
		\Sigma$, $\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \sigma$. This is denoted as
		$\mathbb{M} \models_\lambda \Sigma$ and read "$\mathbb{M}$ is a model
		of $\Sigma$".

	\subsection{Entailment}

		Given an environment $\lambda$, a set of formul{\ae} $\Sigma$ is said
		to \emph{entail} a formula $\sigma$ ($\Sigma \models_\lambda \sigma$)
		if the set of all models satisfied by $\Sigma$ under $\lambda$ is a
		subset of the set of all models satisfied by $\sigma$ under $\lambda$.

		The notation used for satisfiability and entailment is very similar, in
		that the operator used ($\models$) is the same, but they can be
		distinguished by the type of left operand.

	\subsection{Homomorphisms}

		A \emph{homomorphism} from $\mathbb{A}$ to $\mathbb{B}$ is a function
		$h: |\mathbb{A}|\to|\mathbb{B}|$ such that, for each relation symbol
		$R$ and tuple $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n \rangle$ where $a \subseteq
		|\mathbb{A}|$, $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n  \rangle \in R^\mathbb{A}$
		implies $\langle h(a_0) , \ldots , h(a_n) \rangle \in R^\mathbb{B}$.

		A homomorphism $h$ is also a \emph{strong homomorphism} if, for each
		relation symbol $R$ and tuple $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n \rangle$
		where $a \subseteq |\mathbb{A}|$, $\langle a_0 , \ldots , a_n  \rangle
		\in R^\mathbb{A}$ if and only if $\langle h(a_0) , \ldots , h(a_n)
		\rangle \in R^\mathbb{B}$.

		The notation $\mathbb{M} \preceq \mathbb{N}$ means that there exists a
		homomorphism $h : \mathbb{M} \to \mathbb{N}$. The identity function is
		a homomorphism from any model $\mathbb{M}$ to itself.  Homomorphisms
		have the property that $\mathbb{A} \preceq \mathbb{B} \wedge \mathbb{B}
		\preceq \mathbb{C}$ implies $\mathbb{A} \preceq \mathbb{C}$.

		However, $\mathbb{M} \preceq \mathbb{N} \wedge \mathbb{N} \preceq
		\mathbb{M}$ does not imply that $\mathbb{M} = \mathbb{N}$, but instead
		that $\mathbb{M}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ are \emph{homomorphically
		equivalent}.  For example, fix two models $\mathbb{M}$ and $\mathbb{N}$
		that are equivalent except that $\mathbb{N}$ has one more domain
		element than $\mathbb{M}$. Both $\mathbb{M} \preceq \mathbb{N}$ and
		$\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{M}$ are true, yet $\mathbb{M} \neq
		\mathbb{N}$. Homomorphic Equivalence between a model $\mathbb{M}$ and a
		model $\mathbb{N}$ is denoted $\mathbb{M} \simeq \mathbb{N}$.

		Given models $\mathbb{M}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ where $\mathbb{M} \preceq
		\mathbb{N}$ and a formula in positive-existential form $\sigma$, if
		$\mathbb{M} \models \sigma$ then $\mathbb{N} \models \sigma$.

		A homomorphism $h : \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{B}$ is also an
		\emph{isomorphism} when $h$ is 1:1 and onto and the inverse function
		$h^{-1} : \mathbb{B} \to \mathbb{A}$ is a homomorphism.

	\subsection{Minimal Models}

		Minimal models, also called \emph{universal} models, are models for a
		theory with the special property that there exists a homomorphism from
		the minimal model to any other model that satisfies the theory.
		Intuitively, minimal models have no unnecessary entities or relations
		and thus display the least amount of constraint necessary to satisfy
		the theory for which they are minimal.

		More than one minimal model may exist for a given theory, and not every
		theory must have a minimal model. \textbf{give examples}.

		A set of models $\mathcal{M}$ is said to be \emph{jointly minimal} for
		a set of formul{\ae} $\Sigma$ when every model $\mathbb{N}$ such that
		$\mathbb{N} \models \Sigma$ has a homomorphism from a model $\mathbb{M}
		\in \mathcal{M}$ to $\mathbb{N}$.

	\subsection{Positive Existential Form}

		Formul{\ae} in \emph{positive existential form} are constructed using
		only conjunctions ($\wedge$), disjunctions ($\vee$), existential
		quantifications ($\exists$), tautologies ($\top$), contradictions
		($\bot$), equalities, and relations.

		Negation of a relation $R$ with arity $k$ can be implemented by
		assuming another relation $R'$ with arity $k$, adding two formul{\ae}
		to the theory of the form $R \wedge R' \to \bot$ and $\top \to R \vee
		R'$, and using $R'$ where $\neg R$ would be used.

	\subsection{Geometric Logic}

		\emph{Geometric logic} formul{\ae} are implicitly universally
		quantified implications between positive existential formul{\ae}. More
		specifically, a geometric logic formula is of the form
		\[\forall\ (free(F_L) \cup free(F_R)) : F_L \to F_R\]
		where $free$ is the function that returns the set of all free variables
		for a given formula and both $F_L$ and $F_R$ are are first-order logic
		formul{\ae} in positive existential form.

		A set
		of geometric logic formul{\ae} is called a \emph{geometric theory}.

		It is convention to treat a positive existential formula $\sigma$ as
		$\top \to \sigma$ when expecting a geometric logic formula. It is also
		convention to treat a negated positive existential formula $\neg\sigma$
		as $\sigma \to \bot$.

		Examples of geometric logic formul{\ae}

		\begin{tabular}{ll}
		\emph{reflexivity}  \quad  &  $\top \to R[x,x]$                  \\
		\emph{symmetry}     \quad  &  $R[x,y] \to R[y,x]$                \\
		\emph{transitivity} \quad  &  $R[x,y] \wedge R[y,z] \to R[x,z]$  \\
		\end{tabular}
