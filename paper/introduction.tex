\section{Introduction}

	\textbf{ remove this? }

	This document details work done for a Major Qualifying Project at Worcester
	Polytechnic Institute by Michael Ficarra in partial fulfillment of the
	requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.

	Section \ref{sec:technical_background} can be used as a reference for terms
	discussed in later sections. Appendices \ref{sec:appendix_syntax_table} and
	\ref{sec:appendix_glossary} contain a syntax reference and glossary,
	respectively.

	\subsection{Goals}

		The two main goals of this Major Qualifying Project are:

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item to implement an algorithm known as ``the chase" accurately
		and with a well-defined, usable interface, and
		\item to use the chase implementation for a real-world
		application: generating models used in analysis of a specific
		cryptographic protocol
		\end{enumerate}

		Secondary goals include implementing various optimizations and
		integrating the chase implementation into a program that can take
		advantage of the functionality it provides.

	\subsection{The Chase}

		\emph{The chase} (see \ref{sec:chase}) is an algorithm used to find
		jointly minimal models (see
		\ref{sec:technical_background.minimal_models}) for a set of geometric
		logic formul{\ae} (see \ref{sec:technical_background.geometric_logic}).
		Many common real-world problems can be expressed as a set of geometric
		logic formul{\ae}. When these problems have an unbounded scope of
		possible solutions, the chase can be used to find the possible
		solutions that are interesting. This allows researchers to go through
		only models that represent a large set of models rather than testing
		each of the infinite number of models separately.

		To generate these jointly minimal models, the chase begins with a model
		$\mathbb{M}$ that has an empty domain and no facts. The chase goes
		through each formula $\sigma \in T$ in the geometric theory $T$ such that
		$\mathbb{M}$ is not a model of $\sigma$ and alters $\mathbb{M}$ until
		$\mathbb{M}$ is a model of all $\sigma \in T$. Geometric formul{\ae}
		are implications of positive-existential formul{\ae} (see
		\ref{sec:technical_background.geometric_logic}). Positive-existential
		formul{\ae} have the useful property in that adding elements/facts to a
		model that satisfies one will never cause the model to no longer
		satisfy that formula. Because of this, the chase can keep adding to the
		model until all $\sigma \in T$ are satisfied. The set of all models
		generated by this process is a jointly minimal set for the input theory
		$T$.

		The chase is nondeterministic over disjunctions. When a disjunction is
		encountered, a disjunct is chosen fairly, and the chase continues
		deterministically until it encounters another disjunction.

	\subsection{Chase Implementation}

		We will see in section \ref{sec:implementation} that, in a Haskell
		implementation of the chase, all disjuncts of a disjunction can be
		satisfied by forking the chase and returning a list containing the
		concatenation of the lists returned by the forks. In this way, we can
		deterministically calculate a set of jointly minimal models by finding
		all of the models returned by successful runs of a naturally
		nondeterministic algorithm.

	\subsection{Application}

		Cryptographic protocol analysis is the particular application that is
		explored in section \ref{sec:application.strand_spaces}. In this
		application, protocols are modeled in the strand space formalism. Each
		role of every participant in a legal run of the protocol is modeled as
		a strand. The roles of a special participant that does not obey the
		rules of the protocol are called adversary strands (see
		\ref{sec:application.the_adversary}). These adversary strands consist
		of a series of nodes that send/receive messages to/from regular strands
		while manipulating those messages. Because the positions and actions of
		adversary strands are variable, there exists a large number of possible
		runs of a single protocol. It is prohibitive to test all of these to
		find if they break assumptions made about the properties of the
		protocol because of the large number of possibilities. This protocol
		can be represented as a geometric theory and given to the chase to find
		minimal models. When minimal models are found, they can describe nearly
		all interesting ways that the adversaries can interact with regular
		strands. These models can then be analysed in a finite amount of time.
