\section{Introduction}

	This document details work done for a Major Qualifying Project at Worcester
	Polytechnic Institute by Michael Ficarra in partial fulfillment of the
	requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree.

	\subsection{Goals}

		The two main goals of this Major Qualifying Project are:

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item first, to implement an algorithm known as ``the chase" accurately
		and with a well-defined, usable interface
		\item second, to use the chase implementation for a real-world
		application: generating models used in analysis of a specific protocol
		\end{enumerate}

		Secondary goals include implementing various optimizations and
		integrating the chase implementation into a program that can take
		advantage of the functionality it provides.

	\subsection{The Chase}

		\emph{The chase} is an algorithm used to find jointly minimal models
		for a set of geometric logic formul{\ae}. Many common real-world
		problems can be expressed as a set of geometric logic formul{\ae}.
		When these problems have an unbounded scope of possible solutions, the
		chase can be used to find the possible solutions that are interesting.
		This allows researchers to go through only models that will behave
		differently than most models, rather than testing each on separately.
