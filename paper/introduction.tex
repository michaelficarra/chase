\section{Introduction}

	This document details the 

	\subsection{Goals}

		The two main goals of this Major Qualifying Project are:

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item first, to implement an algorithm known as ``the chase" accurately
		and with a well-defined, usable interface
		\item second, to use the chase implementation for a real-world
		application: generating models used in analysis of a specific protocol
		\end{enumerate}

		Secondary goals include implementing various optimizations and
		integrating the chase implementation into a program that can take
		advantage of the functionality it provides.
